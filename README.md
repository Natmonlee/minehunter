For this project I wanted to use more javascript logic and I felt like I understood how I could make this game simply with HTML and CSS, due to its basic graphics.
I really enjoyed seeing the game take shape and I was really happy with how it turned out. I found the javascript pretty simple to write and the main challenge with this project was trying to make the game look appealing considering how basic the layout was. It was also my first time making a dropdown navbar and a modal for the custom options, so it was nice to be a bit more creative with my website design.

For my next project I may try to make something with react and I would like to make an app, rather than a website.
